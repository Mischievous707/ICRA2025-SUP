> For visual target navigation tasks, a suitable environment representation plays a vital part in robot system to complete the navigation tasks. 3D Scene Graphs serve as sparse representations that excel at representing environments efficiently compare to dense semantic maps. Typical Scene Graphs are generally constructed based on multi-level semantic labels with hierarchical structures, which may lead to the loss of valuable spatial information, such as spatial topological relations, common sense understanding and visual context information. In this work, we propose CTSG, a hierarchical 3D scene graph mapping approach for visual object navigation. Our graph adopts a dual-layer structure. Besides object layer, a novel conway (short for context information and way topology) layer is introduced, which consists of topological waypoints with rich multi-modal context information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in novel visual target navigation tasks through simulation and real-world experiments across varied environments and instructions.
